- the build log should (also?) show the `.log` file when build fails (maybe just append it to the regular output)
- fix crash which occurs only in non-debug build when the metropolis assistant is started
- check why e.g. `\Leftrightarrow` doesn't appear in auto-completition
- fix "Next" button becoming sensitive after fixing font issues when all `sty` files are already present
